# Prototype for UBC Course Registration [ Worklist Section ]

The following files describe an alternative to the current designed used in the University of British Columbia. The prototype is part of the CPSC-344 Class by [Karon MacLean](http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~maclean/). This prototype is only applied to the Worklist Section and is an example of a medium fidelity prototype.

This main proposal breaks the worklist into 2 different sections: A draft section where "Saved" courses reside, and a "to-register" section where users can then register their courses. Users drag the courses from the draft version to the register version, so they can the visualize how it looks in their timetable and then compare different versions.

Feel free to review demo [here](http://jjperezaguinaga.github.com/UBC-CoursesWorklist/). Hosted by Github Pages.

**To do**

* Display multiple worklists
* Add up register button
* Timetable design.
